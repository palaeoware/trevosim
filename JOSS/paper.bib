When designing a simulation study, many decisions have to be made and common challenges will be encountered along the way. Here, we outline seven rules for executing a good simulation study. We cover topics including the choice of study question, the empirical data used as a basis for the study, statistical and methodological concerns, how to validate the study, and how to ensure it can be reproduced and extended by others. We hope that these rules and the accompanying examples will guide paleobiologists when using simulation tools to address fundamental questions about the evolution of life.}, number={4}, journal={Paleobiology}, publisher={Cambridge University Press}, author={Barido-Sottani, Joëlle and Saupe, Erin E. and Smiley, Tara M. and Soul, Laura C. and Wright, April M. and Warnock, Rachel C.

These platforms have been used to great effect as a controlled system in which to conduct evolutionary experiments and develop novel evolutionary theory. In addition to their complex evolutionary dynamics, many digital evolution systems also produce rich ecological communities. As a result, digital evolution is also a powerful tool for research on eco-evolutionary dynamics. Here, we review the research to date in which digital evolution platforms have been used to address eco-evolutionary (and in some cases purely ecological) questions. This work has spanned a wide range of topics, including competition, facilitation, parasitism, predation, and macroecological scaling laws. We argue for the value of further ecological research in digital evolution systems and present some particularly promising directions for further research.}, journal={Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution}, author={Dolson, Emily and Ofria, Charles}, year={2021} }

Methods in Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Ecological Society.}, ISSN={2041-210X}, DOI={10.1111/2041-210X.14306}, abstractNote={Simulating biological realistic data is an important step to understand and investigate biodiversity. Simulated data can be used to generate null, base line or neutral models. These can be used either in comparison to observed data to estimate the mechanisms that generated the data. Or they can be used to explore, understand and develop theoretical advances by proposing toy models. In evolutionary biology, simulations often involve the need of an evolutionary process where descent with modification is at the core of how the simulated data are generated. These evolutionary processes can then be nearly infinitely modified to include complex processes that affect the simulations such as traits co-evolution, competition mechanisms or mass extinction events. Here I present the treats package, a modular R package for trees and traits simulations. This package is based on a simple birth death algorithm from which all steps can easily be modified by users. treats also provides a tidy interface through the treats object, allowing users to easily run reproducible simulations. It also comes with an extend manual regularly updated following users’ questions or suggestions.}, number={4}, journal={Methods in Ecology and Evolution}, author={Guillerme, Thomas}, year={2024}, pages={647–656}, language={en} }

Incorporating them into phylogenetic hypotheses of living clades can help time-calibrate divergences, as well as elucidate macroevolutionary dynamics. However, the effect fossils have on phylogenetic reconstruction from morphology remains controversial. The consequences of explicitly incorporating the stratigraphic ages of fossils using tip-dated inference are also unclear. Here, we use simulations to evaluate the performance of inference methods across different levels of fossil sampling and missing data. Our results show that fossil taxa improve phylogenetic analysis of morphological datasets, even when highly fragmentary. Irrespective of inference method, fossils improve the accuracy of phylogenies and increase the number of resolved nodes. They also induce the collapse of ancient and highly uncertain relationships that tend to be incorrectly resolved when sampling only extant taxa. Furthermore, tip-dated analyses under the fossilized birth–death process outperform undated methods of inference, demonstrating that the stratigraphic ages of fossils contain vital phylogenetic information. Fossils help to extract true phylogenetic signals from morphology, an effect that is mediated by both their distinctive morphology and their temporal information, and their incorporation in total-evidence phylogenetics is necessary to faithfully reconstruct evolutionary history.}, number={1950}, journal={Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences}, publisher={Royal Society}, author={Mongiardino Koch, Nicolás and Garwood, Russell J. and Parry, Luke A.}, year={2021}, month=may, pages={20210044} }

Palaeontology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of The Palaeontological Association.}, ISSN={1475-4983}, DOI={10.1111/pala.12680}, abstractNote={Time-scaled phylogenies underpin the interrogation of evolutionary processes across deep timescales, as well as attempts to link these to Earth’s history. By inferring the placement of fossils and using their ages as temporal constraints, tip dating under the fossilized birth–death (FBD) process provides a coherent prior on divergence times. At the same time, it also links topological and temporal accuracy, as incorrectly placed fossil terminals should misinform divergence times. This could pose serious issues for obtaining accurate node ages, yet the interaction between topological and temporal error has not been thoroughly explored. We simulate phylogenies and associated morphological datasets using methodologies that incorporate evolution under selection, and are benchmarked against empirical datasets. We find that datasets of 300 characters and realistic levels of missing data generally succeed in inferring the correct placement of fossils on a constrained extant backbone topology, and that true node ages are usually contained within Bayesian posterior distributions. While increased fossil sampling improves the accuracy of inferred ages, topological and temporal errors do not seem to be linked: analyses in which fossils resolve less accurately do not exhibit elevated errors in node age estimates. At the same time, inferred divergence times are biased, probably due to a mismatch between the FBD prior and the shape of our simulated trees. While these results are encouraging, suggesting that even fossils with uncertain affinities can provide useful temporal information, they also emphasize that palaeontological information cannot overturn discrepancies between model priors and the true diversification history.}, number={6}, journal={Palaeontology}, author={Mongiardino Koch, Nicolás and Garwood, Russell J. and Parry, Luke A.}, year={2023}, pages={e12680}, language={en} }
 @article{Puttick_O_Reilly_Pisani_Donoghue_2019, title={Probabilistic methods outperform parsimony in the phylogenetic analysis of data simulated without a probabilistic model}, volume={62}, ISSN={00310239}, DOI={10.1111/pala.12388}, abstractNote={Abstract: To understand patterns and processes of the diversiﬁcation of life, we require an accurate understanding of taxon interrelationships. Recent studies have suggested that analyses of morphological character data using the Bayesian and maximum likelihood Mk model provide phylogenies of higher accuracy compared to parsimony methods. This has proved controversial, particularly studies simulating morphology-data under Markov models that assume shared branch lengths for characters, as it is claimed this leads to bias favouring the Bayesian or maximum likelihood Mk model over parsimony models which do not explicitly make this assumption. We avoid these potential issues by employing a simulation protocol in which character states are randomly assigned to tips, but datasets are constrained to an empirically realistic distribution of homoplasy as measured by the consistency index. Datasets were analysed with equal weights and implied weights parsimony, and the maximum likelihood and Bayesian Mk model. We ﬁnd that consistent (low homoplasy) datasets render method choice largely irrelevant, as all methods perform well with high consistency (low homoplasy) datasets, but the largest discrepancies in accuracy occur with low consistency datasets (high homoplasy). In such cases, the Bayesian Mk model is signiﬁcantly more accurate than alternative models and implied weights parsimony never signiﬁcantly outperforms the Bayesian Mk model. When poorly supported branches are collapsed, the Bayesian Mk model recovers trees with higher resolution compared to other methods. As it is not possible to assess homoplasy independently of a tree estimate, the Bayesian Mk model emerges as the most reliable approach for categorical morphological analyses.}, number={1}, journal={Palaeontology}, author={Puttick, Mark N. and O’Reilly, Joseph E. and Pisani, Davide and Donoghue, Philip C.
